//Pseudo code tofind average of odd numbers
//Problem is mathematical calculation
//Steps to keep count of odd numbers input by a user then finding its average
// Inputs: numbers and characters to break the sytem
//Outputs: average of odd numbers

Prompt the user to enter numbers and a certain character to break the system
input numbers
input character to end the input
  OddCount=0
  sum=0
IF(number<0)
 output: please enter a natural number
IF(number%2!=0)
  THEN OddCount=OddCount+1
   AND sum=sum+number
IF(number==Character to stop input)
   BREAK
     THEN output OddCount
     AND otput (average=sum/OddCount)
